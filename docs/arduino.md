In a nutshell: there are two arduino scripts

* one to measure angles with the encoder
* one to control the electromagnet (with additional functions)
    * this script requires you to build the arduino shield.

In the future all of this code should be placed on one Arduino,
and the shield updated to a V2, which is future work.
